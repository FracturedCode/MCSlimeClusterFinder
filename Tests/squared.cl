Squares elements in an array.
Code that contains kernels to run on accelerator in parallel. A kernel 
represents the basic unit of executable code. Each kernel will be 
executed on one work item ("pixel") of your parallel task:
1 work item = 1 "pixel" in your image 
A practical application may generate thousands or even millions of 
work-items, but for the simple task of adding 64 numbers, 
eight work-items will suffice.
